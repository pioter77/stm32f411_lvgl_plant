 * +PLANT_STATE_OFF: 		when plant is toggled to off state and not used, process isnt running, watter wont flow and adc readouts are ignored
 * +PLANT_STATE_STANDBY:	when plant is toggled on state and process is running but soil humidity level is higher than watering threshold so nothing than updating adc to screen is needed
 * +PLANT_STATE_WATERING:   when plant is toggled on state and no other plant isnt being watered and time is within time window so water is being pumped into the plant pot by the pump
 * +PLANT_STATE_CHECKING:   when plant is toggled on state and plant has been in WATERING state up to 20 mins before so we check if water ammount pumped to plant was sufficient and if humidity level
 * 							required hasnt been reached we try to water the plant again in hope tat humidity will increase enough
 * +PLANT_STATE_WAITING		when plant is toggled on state and humidty level is lover than required but cannot be switched to WATERIGN state becouse other pump is being watered or current time
 * 							isnt within specified time widnow for watering
